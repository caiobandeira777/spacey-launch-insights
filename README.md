# ðŸš€ SpaceY Launch Predictor

**SpaceY Launch Predictor** is a data science project designed to support the strategic and operational decisions of **SpaceY**, a fictional aerospace company aiming to compete with SpaceX.

Using publicly available data from SpaceX, the project builds a machine learning model to predict the reuse of the first rocket stage and estimate launch prices based on mission characteristics. Dashboards are also developed to provide actionable insights for various company departments.
